This directory contains a java version of a Wythoff game. 
This one is divided into two versions, one player VS player and another player VS AI.

The AI strategy is as follows: 
- Initially, the AI will analyze the possibilities of movement, i.e., the 
left, down, and diagonal, if in one of its three directions it notices a 
Winning position, she goes there right away.
- Otherwise, it performs a random move
